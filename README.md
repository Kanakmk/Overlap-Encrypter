### Overlap-Encrypter
```
This program takes user input (a string of words) and combines the words 
that have the same ending as the beginning of the next word.

The input (from standard input) will consist of a sentence on each line, 
assuming that single spaces separate each word. 
It combines individual lines and outputs the result (each on their own line). 
It does not combine across lines. 
Processes all input until the End-Of-File (EOF) is encountered.
